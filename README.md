## 1. Introduction

Vana turns data into currency to push the frontiers of decentralized AI. It is a layer one blockchain designed for private, user-owned data. It allows users to collectively own, govern, and earn from the AI models trained on their data. For more context see this [docs](https://docs.vana.org/vana).


## 2. Overview

### Data Registry Contract

The data registry is the main entry point for data in the Vana network.

The data registry contract functions as a central repository for managing all data within the network, functioning as a comprehensive file catalog. It allows users to add new files to the system, with each file receiving a unique identifier for future reference.

The contract manages access control for these files, enabling file owners to grant specific addresses permission to access their files. It also handles the storage of file metadata, including any offchain proofs or attestations related to file validation, which can include various metrics such as authenticity, ownership, and quality scores. Users can retrieve detailed information about any file in the registry using its unique identifier, including its permissions and associated proofs.

### TEE Pool Contract

The TEE Pool orchestrates TEEs in the Satya Network.

The Satya Network specializes in the validation of data contributions to DataDAOs, running their Proof of Contribution. These validators operate within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), ensuring that data can be validated securely and privately. This allows for privacy-preserving validation, where the data being processed is shielded from both the validator and external parties.

The TEE Pool contract manages and coordinates the TEE Validators and serves as an escrow for holding fees associated with validation tasks. Users pay a fee to submit data for validation, and the contract ensures that the validators process the data and provide proof of validation. The contract also allows the owner to add or remove validators, and it securely holds and disburses the fees related to these validation services.

### VanaPoolEntity Contract

The VanaPool protocol offers a flexible, yield-generating staking ecosystem built on the Vana blockchain. It creates a marketplace where users can stake their VANA tokens into various entities, each with its own risk profile, APY settings, and reward structure, allowing for diversification across investment options while maintaining liquidity.

VanaPoolEntity serves as the central registry for all yield-generating entities within the protocol, maintaining their status, reward pools, and configuration settings. It calculates rewards using a sophisticated continuous compounding formula that accurately reflects time-based accumulation.

The contract implements dynamic share pricing that automatically adjusts based on rewards processed, ensuring that all stakers receive fair value regardless of when they enter or exit. Entity owners can contribute additional rewards to their pools, which are distributed proportionally to stakers according to their share ownership.

VanaPoolEntity also handles entity lifecycle management including registration, updates, and status changes, while enforcing protocol rules such as minimum stake requirements and valid naming conventions.

### VanaPoolStaking Contract

VanaPoolStaking provides the user-facing interface for interacting with the protocol, allowing participants to stake their VANA tokens into any active entity. It manages the issuance and redemption of entity shares, which represent proportional ownership in an entity's staking pool.

The contract implements comprehensive slippage protection mechanisms to prevent value extraction during high volatility periods, ensuring users receive fair value during both stake and unstake operations. It supports flexible staking options including the ability to designate different recipients for shares, enabling delegation and custody solutions.

VanaPoolStaking maintains detailed records of all user positions across different entities, enabling portfolio diversification while preserving accurate accounting. It coordinates closely with VanaPoolEntity to ensure that reward processing occurs at critical moments such as stake or unstake operations.

### VanaPoolTreasury Contract

VanaPoolTreasury acts as the secure vault for all protocol assets, isolating fund management from business logic to enhance security. It implements strict access controls that ensure only authorized contracts can withdraw funds, protecting user deposits from unauthorized access.

The treasury maintains accurate accounting of all protocol assets and handles the mechanics of token transfers during unstaking operations, ensuring that users receive exactly the correct amount based on their share value.

### Root Epoch Contract

Handles epoch-based operations including creation, finalization, and reward distribution for DLPs across time periods.

The DLPRootEpoch contract manages the temporal structure of the Vana ecosystem through a system of epochs, which are fixed time periods (measured in blocks) during which DLPs can participate and earn rewards. It handles epoch creation, finalization, and the distribution of rewards to eligible DLPs based on their performance and stake amounts within each epoch.

Each epoch has a defined start and end block, a total reward amount to be distributed, and tracks participating DLPs along with their stake scores. The contract enables dynamic epoch creation, ensuring the system always has future epochs available for participation. When an epoch ends, it can be finalized, which locks in the participating DLPs and their metrics, and triggers the reward distribution process based on the stake scores and performance metrics from DLPRootMetrics.

The contract implements sophisticated reward calculation and distribution mechanisms that account for both the stake amount and performance rating of each DLP. It provides functions to query historical data about epochs and DLP participation, allowing for transparent tracking of rewards and performance over time. The epoch structure is configurable, with adjustable parameters like epoch size, reward amount, and maximum DLPs per epoch, providing flexibility to adapt the protocol as the ecosystem grows.

### DLPRootCore Contract
Manages the DLP (Delegation Liquidity Provider) lifecycle including registration, verification, and stake management with eligibility thresholds.

The DLPRootCore contract manages the lifecycle of Delegation Liquidity Providers (DLPs) in the Vana ecosystem, handling registration, verification, and eligibility status. It serves as the central registry for all DLPs, storing critical information such as their addresses, ownership details, stake amounts, and verification status, which determine their eligibility to participate in the ecosystem.

The contract implements a tiered eligibility system with configurable thresholds that determine whether a DLP can participate in epochs and receive rewards. DLPs can be in various states including Registered, Eligible, SubEligible, or Deregistered, with transitions between these states triggered by changes in stake amounts or administrative actions. The eligibility mechanism ensures that only DLPs meeting minimum stake requirements and verification standards can actively participate in the protocol.

A key feature of the contract is its historical data tracking using checkpoints, which record stake amounts and staker reward percentages at different points in time. This allows for accurate historical queries when calculating rewards for past epochs. The contract also manages the distribution between staker and owner rewards through configurable percentages, balancing incentives for both DLP operators and their stakers while maintaining security through comprehensive role-based access controls.

### DLPRoot Staking Contract

Core contract managing staking functionality including stake creation, withdrawal, migration, and reward claiming.

The DLPRoot contract serves as the central hub of the Vana staking ecosystem, managing the core staking functionality for users who want to support DLPs. It coordinates the interactions between stakers, DLPs, and the various specialized contracts in the system, including DLPRootCore, DLPRootEpoch, DLPRootMetrics, and DLPRootTreasury.

The contract enables users to create stakes on DLPs, with stakes tracked by amount, start block, and associated DLP. It implements a sophisticated reward calculation system based on stake duration and the performance of the chosen DLP, with longer stake periods receiving multiplier bonuses. Stakers can close and withdraw their stakes after optional waiting periods, or migrate their stakes to different DLPs, providing flexibility while ensuring system stability.

A key feature is the integrated reward claiming mechanism, where stakers can claim their portion of rewards earned by the DLPs they've supported, with rewards calculated based on stake score relative to total stake scores for that DLP in each epoch. The contract employs checkpoints to track historical values like withdrawal delays and claim delays, enabling accurate historical queries. The entire system is secured through role-based access controls, ensuring that sensitive operations like treasury transfers can only be performed by authorized entities.

### DLPRootMetrics Contract

The DLPRootMetrics contract manages DataDAO performance ratings and DLP reward distributiion.

The DLPRootMetrics contract calculates and tracks performance metrics for DataDAOs in the Vana ecosystem, working alongside the DLP Root contract to determine reward distribution. It uses a dual-rating system that combines stake amounts with performance metrics, where each DataDAO receives a performance rating every epoch based on their activities and contributions.

The contract implements a weighted scoring system where both stake amount and performance metrics influence the final rating, with configurable percentages for each component. This ensures that DataDAOs are incentivized not just to maintain high stake amounts, but also to perform well in their operations. Performance ratings are submitted by Vana Oracle and become final at the end of each epoch, determining the reward distribution among the top DataDAOs.

To promote long-term engagement, the system includes a multiplier mechanism that increases based on staking duration, reaching up to 300% after 64 days of staking. This multiplier affects the stake score component of the rating, while the performance component is determined by the DataDAO's actual operations and effectiveness. The contract allows for dynamic updates to performance ratings within an epoch until finalization, ensuring the system can adapt to changing conditions while maintaining security through role-based access control.

### DLPRootTreasuries

The DLPRootTreasury contracts securely manage staked and reward VANA tokens in the DLPRoot

The DLPRootTreasury contracts, consisting of DLPRootStakesTreasury and DLPRootRewardsTreasury, serve as the financial backbone of the DLPRoot system, each managing distinct aspects of VANA token flows. The DLPRootStakesTreasury securely holds all staked VANA tokens, processing deposits from both DataDAO registrations and user staking operations, while implementing strict withdrawal controls to prevent manipulation and ensure system stability.

The DLPRootRewardsTreasury complements this by managing the reward distribution process, holding VANA tokens allocated for epoch rewards and facilitating their distribution to both DataDAO treasuries and stakers. This separation of concerns ensures that staked tokens remain secure and isolated from reward operations, while maintaining efficient reward distribution channels for the ecosystem's incentive mechanisms.

By operating as separate entities but working in concert, these treasury contracts create a robust financial infrastructure that supports the DLPRoot's staking and reward mechanics. The dual-treasury design enables clear tracking of token flows and provides enhanced security through compartmentalization, ensuring that stake-related operations and reward distributions are handled through their respective dedicated pathways.

### Data Liquidity Pool & DLPToken

A Data Liquidity Pool (DLP) is a core component of the Vana ecosystem, designed to transform raw data into a liquid asset. It functions as a smart contract on the Vana blockchain that allows users to monetize, control, and govern their data in a decentralized manner. Each DLP can have its own token, providing contributors with ongoing rewards and governance rights.

**DataRegistry**, **TEEPool**, and **RootNetwork** are part of the Vana core smart contracts and do not need to be deployed by DLP builders. For testing and integration, you should use the addresses deployed on Moksha. However, you will need to deploy your own **Data Liquidity Pool** & **DLPToken** (either the template version suggested by us or your own version). Keep in mind that to be part of the Vana ecosystem and qualify for the DLP rewards program, the DLP contract needs to be integrated with **DataRegistry** and **RootNetwork** as shown in the template in this repository.

### Multisend
The multisend contract allows users to send multiple transactions in a single call. This is useful for batch operations such as distributing rewards/gas fees to multiple addresses. The contract is designed to optimize gas usage and reduce the number of transactions required for these operations.

### Multicall3
The Multicall3 contract is a direct implementation of the widely-used [mds1's Multicall3 contract](#https://github.com/mds1/multicall), enabling batching of multiple smart contract calls into a single transaction to reduce gas costs and improve efficiency. It provides various aggregation methods with configurable error handling and supports value transfers, making it a powerful tool for complex operations within the Vana ecosystem. The contract includes multiple call aggregation patterns - from simple batching requiring all calls to succeed, to sophisticated methods allowing per-call failure handling and ETH value attachments. This makes it particularly valuable for operations requiring interaction with multiple contracts or performing bulk operations like reward distributions and state updates.

## 3. Flow

### Data Contributor Flow

The following describes the process of contributing data to a DLP from a user's perspective:

Bob wants to become a data contributor for DLP1. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Bob uploads his file to the DataRegistry (a URL with encrypted data).  
   E.g.https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0x900e23d55bf7706973376ff7da5a649bbf3d470bfd9020dc66d9830fd4dbd1d3
2. Bob requests an attestation by adding a new job in the TeePool.  
   E.g.https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0x40c58020c0cf10c8c53e412f209b60c923dc7a8c7513bf94fefe189a736b7f96?tab=logs
3. TEE operators see Bob's job and create an attestation for that file based on the instructions required for validating the file in relation to DLP1.
4. This proof is saved in the DataRegistry.  
   E.g.https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0x2f4dba67e90685429b73a43e74fe839e580c9e50f60ce5d460b19f88f56a2e99?tab=index
5. Bob must grant access to the DLP to read the data (by encrypting the file with the specific publicKey of DLP1).  
   E.g.https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0xfeeda337eeb60367a8332a664087cbef5b4e7f0882af30e36c5259c43a7042cc

   This step can be done by Bob in the first step by passing the permission along with the file.  
   E.g.https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0xb54582c8bfa1940a2003dff4aa729f36effeef4537181e1a68d009b32a5880d0

7. After Bob's file receives the necessary attestation, he must inform DLP1 that he owns a file and a valid proof intended for this DLP. Bob will be automatically rewarded based on the score obtained from the attestation by the TEE operator.  
   E.g. https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0x69c07a8e0e5fd3a2f9b9c063c4c4f1f56a9aabb18b5c0f07bd10107d0844ebd9

This process ensures that data is securely contributed, validated, and rewarded within the Vana ecosystem.

To save Bob from paying transaction fees, the DLP can act as a proxy between Bob and the smart contracts. Bob provides the DLP app with the necessary information, and the DLP can perform all the required transactions on Bob's behalf. Bob remains the owner of the file and the recipient of the allocated reward.

It's important to emphasize that this is just an example of Bob's interaction with the smart contracts. In practice, there should be a user interface (UI) that comes packaged with these contracts to assist users. This UI would simplify the process for users, making it easier for them to interact with the DLP ecosystem without needing to directly interact with the smart contracts.

### Reward distribution

The RootNetwork smart contract manages the reward distribution for Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) in the Vana ecosystem. Here's a detailed explanation of how the reward system works:

#### DLP Registration and Staking

1. Each DLP must register in the RootNetwork contract using the `registerDLP` method.
2. During registration, the DLP specifies a `stakersPercentage`, which determines the proportion of rewards that will go to the DLP's stakers. The remainder goes to the DLP owner.

E.g.  https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0x84532d83be589ec1c13d9de04e426dcc7c54652060f8f78032a416d9f5dc159b

#### Epoch System

- The RootNetwork operates on an epoch-based timeline (1 hour on moksha)

#### DLP Selection Process

1. At the end of each epoch, the top 16 DLPs are selected based on their total staked amount.
2. Only these 16 DLPs participate in that epoch.
3. Other DLPs can compete for future epochs by accumulating more stakes.

#### Reward Distribution

1. At the end of each epoch, rewards are distributed to the 16 participating DLPs based on their performance during the epoch.
2. For each DLP:
    - A portion of the reward goes to the DLP owner.
    - The rest is reserved for the DLP's stakers (as per the `stakersPercentage`).
3. Staker rewards are not distributed automatically; each staker must claim their rewards individually.

#### Data Contributor Rewards

- Each DLP is responsible for rewarding its data contributors.
- The method and currency for these rewards are at the discretion of each DLP.
- In the DLP template from this repository:
    - The DLP uses its own currency for rewards.
    - Reward amount is proportional to the score of the uploaded file.
    - More details can be found in the specific DLP documentation.

#### Flexibility in Reward Mechanisms

- DLPs can modify their reward mechanism for data contributors:
- They may choose to use VANA tokens instead of a custom currency.
- They could distribute part or all of the rewards received from the RootNetwork to data contributors.
- More complex reward calculation mechanisms can be implemented.

#### Important Considerations

- The selection of top DLPs occurs at the start of each epoch, so staking positions at that time are crucial.
- Stakers should regularly check and claim their rewards to ensure they receive their share.
- DLP owners should carefully consider their `stakersPercentage` to balance attracting stakers and maintaining profitability.
- Data contributors should understand the specific reward mechanism of each DLP they contribute to.

This reward system incentivizes DLPs to perform well and attract stakers, while also providing flexibility in how they reward their data contributors. It creates a competitive ecosystem where DLPs strive for top positions to participate in epochs and earn rewards.


## 4. Installation

The deployment scripts will also verify the contract on blockscout.

#### 5. Register your DLP on the RootNetwork
After deploying your DLP, you need to register it on the RootNetwork contract. This will allow your DLP to participate in the Vana ecosystem and receive rewards. To register your DLP, call the `registerDlp` function on the RootNetwork contract.

   ```solidity
   function registerDlp(
       address dlpAddress,
       address payable dlpOwnerAddress,
       uint256 stakersPercentage
   ) external payable
   ```

    - `dlpAddress`: The address of your DLP contract
    - `dlpOwnerAddress`: The address that will be set as the owner of the DLP
    - `stakersPercentage`: The percentage of rewards that will be distributed to stakers (in 18 decimal format, e.g., 50% would be 50e18)
- Send the required stake amount with the transaction. The value sent with the transaction (`msg.value`) must be at least the `minDlpStakeAmount` (0.1 Vana on moksha).

E.g.  https://moksha.vanascan.io/tx/0x84532d83be589ec1c13d9de04e426dcc7c54652060f8f78032a416d9f5dc159b

### After Registration

Upon successful registration:
1. The DLP is assigned a unique ID.
2. The DLP's details are stored in the contract.
3. The sent stake amount is recorded for the DLP owner as a stake.
4. The DLP is added to the list of registered DLPs.
5. Users can start staking VANA tokens to the DLP to participate in the reward distribution.

### DLP Template Contracts


<a id="contracts-data-liquidity-pool"></a>
### DataLiquidityPool

This contract is designed to be upgradeable using the Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) pattern. This allows for future improvements while maintaining the contract's state and address.

For more information on the UUPS pattern and how to work with upgradeable contracts, please refer to the OpenZeppelin documentation:
- [Proxy Upgrade Pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies)
- [Writing Upgradeable Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable)

#### Methods

```solidity
function initialize(InitParams memory params) external initializer
```
Initializes the contract with the given parameters.

Parameters:
- `params`: A struct containing initialization parameters
    - `trustedForwarder`: The address of the trusted forwarder contract. See [this section](#env-truested_forwarder_address) for more details.
    - `ownerAddress`: The address of the contract owner. (E.g. **0x853407D0C625Ce7E43C0a2596fBc470C3a6f8305**)
    - `tokenAddress`: The address of the ERC20 token used for rewards. (E.g. **0xF3D9A139a7ba707843dD4f1FDfE0F9E55D9D8d6b**)
    - `dataRegistryAddress`: The address of the data registry contract. (E.g. **0xEA882bb75C54DE9A08bC46b46c396727B4BFe9a5**)
    - `teePoolAddress`: The address of the TEE pool contract. (E.g. **0xF084Ca24B4E29Aa843898e0B12c465fAFD089965**)
    - `name`: The name of the data liquidity pool. (E.g. **CookieDLP**)
    - `publicKey`: A public key for your DLP, used for encryption purposes. See [this section](#env-dlp-public-key) for more details.
    - `proofInstruction`: The instruction for generating proofs. (E.g. **https://github.com/vana-com/vana-satya-proof-template/releases/download/v24/gsc-my-proof-24.tar.gz**)
    - `fileRewardFactor`: The factor used to calculate file rewards. (E.g. **2e18** => the reward multiplier is 2)


Tee validators calculate a total score for the files they verify, based on the set of instructions executed to generate the proof. This score ranges between 0 and 1 (i.e., between 0 and 1e18). At the end, the dataContributor will receive a reward. DLP_FILE_REWARD_FACTOR is used to convert the score into the amount of DLP tokens the data contributor receives for their file. Essentially, the reward is calculated using the formula:  
```reward = fileScore * DLP_FILE_REWARD_FACTOR ```
