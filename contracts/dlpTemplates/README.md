# DLP Templates Contracts

This folder contains the essential smart contract templates that DataDAO creators must deploy to launch their own Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) within the Vana ecosystem. These templates provide the foundational implementations for creating DataDAOs - collectively governed datasets that aggregate, verify, and monetize individual user data while maintaining user ownership and control through cryptographic mechanisms.

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts

Set up and deploy your DataDAO's smart contracts on the Moksha Testnet. For the complete deployment guide, see [Deploy Smart Contracts](https://docs.vana.org/docs/2-register-datadao).

**Clone and Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vana-com/vana-smart-contracts.git
cd vana-smart-contracts
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

**Configure `.env`:**

Edit `.env` with these **required** fields:

```bash
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=...           # Your private_key from the previous step, 62-64 letters  
OWNER_ADDRESS=0x...                # Your wallet address from the previous step, 40-42 letters
DLP_NAME=QuickstartDAO             # Name of your DataDAO
DLP_PUBLIC_KEY=045...              # Your wallet public_key from the previous step, 128-132 letters 
DLP_TOKEN_NAME=QuickToken          # Token name
DLP_TOKEN_SYMBOL=QTKN              # Token symbol 
```

ðŸš§ **Security Note:** `.env` files contain sensitive keys. Do **not** commit this file to Git or share it â€” anyone with access to your `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` can take control of your contracts.

**These examples are for format reference only â€” do not use them in production:**
```bash
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=48fe86dc5053bf2c6004a24c0965bd2142fe921a074ffe93b440f0ada662d16d
OWNER_ADDRESS=0x18781A2B6B843E0BBe4F491B28139abb6942d785
DLP_PUBLIC_KEY=04920ff366433d60fcebfa9d072d860e6fd7a482e4c055621ef986025076c9fb6418c15712a22bff61a3add75b645345c7c338f19a8ab0d1a3ac6be1be331eac45
```

You can leave other fields (e.g., `DLP_PROOF_INSTRUCTION`, `DLP_FILE_REWARD_FACTOR`) as defaults for testing.

**Deploy to Moksha Testnet:**

The repository contains many smart contracts used across the Vana ecosystem. The `DLPDeploy` tag deploys only the contracts required to launch your DataDAO:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network moksha --tags DLPDeploy
```

After deployment, **save these critical addresses** from the output logs:
- `Token Address` - Your VRC-20 token contract
- `DataLiquidityPoolProxy` - Your main DLP contract
- `Vesting Wallet Address` - Team token vesting contract

You may see error logs related to contract verification. **You can safely ignore those messages** - all contracts will be verified onchain.

**View Your Contracts on Vanascan:**

Visit [moksha.vanascan.io](https://moksha.vanascan.io) and search for each contract address:
- Your **token contract** shows metadata, total supply, and recent token transfers
- Your **DataLiquidityPoolProxy** contract has methods viewable in the **Contract** tab
- Your **VestingWallet** contains the vesting schedule and logic for team token allocation

### 2. Register DataDAO

Now that you've deployed your smart contracts, register your DataDAO onchain in the global DLP registry. For the complete registration guide, see [Register DataDAO](https://docs.vana.org/docs/2-register-datadao).

**Register via DLPRegistryProxy:**

1. Navigate to the [registerDlp](https://moksha.vanascan.io/address/0x4D59880a924526d1dD33260552Ff4328b1E18a43?tab=read_write_proxy&source_address=0x752301d732e3Ef8fbFCAa700e25C3Fa1a6D1629e#0x9d4def70) method in DLPRegistryProxy on Vanascan
2. Fill in the `registrationInfo` fields:
    - `dlpAddress`: The `DataLiquidityPoolProxy` address you saved from deployment
    - `ownerAddress`: Your wallet address
    - `treasuryAddress`: A separate wallet for DLP treasury (can be same as `ownerAddress` for testing)
    - `name`: The `DLP_NAME` you chose (e.g., "QuickstartDAO") - **must be unique**
    - `iconUrl`: Optional logo URL (e.g., `https://example.com/icon.png`)
    - `website`: Optional project link (e.g., `https://example.com`)
    - `metadata`: Optional JSON (e.g., `{"description": "Test DLP"}`)

3. Fill in `Send native VANA (uint256)`:
    - Click the `Ã—10^18` button to set 1 VANA (in wei) - **required deposit**

4. Connect your wallet (`OWNER_ADDRESS`) to Vanascan and submit the transaction

5. **Retrieve your `dlpId`:**
    - Go to the [dlpIds](https://moksha.vanascan.io/address/0x4D59880a924526d1dD33260552Ff4328b1E18a43?tab=read_write_proxy&source_address=0x752301d732e3Ef8fbFCAa700e25C3Fa1a6D1629e#0xc06020b0) method in the DLPRegistryProxy contract
    - Use your `dlpAddress` to query your dlpId from the blockchain

ðŸš§ **Tip:** You can update your registration info later using the `updateDlp` function. All metadata is editable.

## System Architecture

### What is a DataDAO?

DataDAOs are collectively governed datasets that aggregate and verify individual user data, transforming it from isolated information into valuable, liquid assets. They address fundamental challenges in the data economy:

**The Aggregation Challenge:** Individual user data isn't useful on its own - it must be pooled to be valuable for AI training and other applications. While centralized platforms can aggregate user data, DataDAOs enable users to export their data and pool it collectively while maintaining ownership through cryptographic mechanisms.

**Core Problems Solved:**
- **Sybil Resistance**: Proof-of-contribution prevents users from creating fake identities to manipulate datasets
- **Data Valuation**: Dataset-specific validation logic verifies authenticity and assigns value scores to map heterogeneous data contributions to standardized tokens

### Core Components

**Data Liquidity Pool (DLP)** - Smart contracts containing:
- Proof-of-contribution validators that verify data authenticity and assign value scores
- Refinement structures that process raw data into queryable formats
- Access control contracts that enforce data token-gated permissions

**VRC-20 Token Economics** - Dataset-specific tokens earned for validated contributions and burned for access, with ERC-20 compatibility enabling programmable economic logic

**Governance Layer** - Token-weighted decisions on validation criteria, economic parameters, and access policies

### Technical Flow

1. **Data Contribution**: User contributes data â†’ DLP validates and refines â†’ user earns VRC-20 tokens
2. **Data Access**: AI builder burns VANA + VRC-20 tokens â†’ access granted to TEE environment
3. **Secure Computation**: TEE runtime enforces DataDAO permissions during computation (only approved code runs)
4. **Value Distribution**: Value flows to token holders based on ownership stake and actual data usage

### Key Properties

- **Programmable Validation**: Executable proof-of-contribution scripts ensure data quality
- **Cryptographic Attribution**: Tokens are cryptographically linked to wallet contributions
- **Granular Access Control**: TEE-level enforcement of DataDAO-defined permissions
- **Democratic Governance**: Token-weighted governance proportional to contribution volume
