# Vana Staking Contracts

This folder contains the VanaPool protocol smart contracts that provide a flexible, yield-generating staking ecosystem built on the Vana blockchain. The system creates a comprehensive marketplace where users can stake their VANA tokens into various entities, each with its own risk profile, APY settings, and reward structure, enabling diversification across investment options while maintaining liquidity and security.
